      <description>This is a take on a traditional demi-glace without needing to buy an astronomically large amount of veal bones. Use this as your main base for pan sauces, an extra flavor bomb, or a replacement for recipes that call for broth or stock.
These are the basic proportions &amp;ndash; multiply as needed. I typically multiply by six to give me several weeks worth of demi-glace ice cubes.
Ingredients  1 qt (32 oz, 946mL) low-sodium broth or stock (I prefer Pacific Foods) 1 1/4 oz (7g) packet unflavored, unsweetened gelatin 1 teaspoon (5mL) tomato paste 1 teaspoon (5mL) low-sodium soy sauce 1/2 teaspoon onion powder (very optional)  Directions  Put the tomato paste in a large pot, then turn the heat on medium Spread the paste around the bottom of the pot and stir until it just barely starts to brown Deglaze with the broth Stir in all other ingredients and boil over high heat until reduced to about 1/6th of its original volume Freeze in ice cub trays  Contribution Dan - ETH 0xC86468549c180A296384aAC2F76c8F581691Bc1b</description>

      <description>Aioli is pretty much just mayonnaise with garlic, although traditional aioli only includes olive oil and garlic, and no eggs or acid. This recipe uses raw eggs, so if that is sketchy in your region use pasteurized eggs ü•ö.
