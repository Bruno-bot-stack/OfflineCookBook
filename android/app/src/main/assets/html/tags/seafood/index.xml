Anglerfish (I&amp;rsquo;m referring specifically to the &amp;lsquo;monfish/sea-devil&amp;rsquo; variant) meat is mild, absorbing the butter and subtle flavours of the herbs. Preparing the anglerfish is an involved process that I&amp;rsquo;ll try and explain to the best of my abilities but watching someone do it would be more then helpful.
Ingredients 1 Anglerfish Butter, enough to fry with Chives or green onions Marjoram, fresh herbs are preferable Directions Preparing the fish Turn the creature on its back.</description></item></channel></rss>
