Best served with a sauce such as an onion raitha.
A plated rendering of the dish, made with Mutton. Makes a really hearty ,meaty and delicious dish. The dishes uses a rice to meat ratio of 2:3. PS: the biriyani tastes better the longer it&amp;rsquo;s allowed to soak in it&amp;rsquo;s flavour after cooking.</description></item></channel></rss>
