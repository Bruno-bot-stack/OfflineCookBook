It is similar to strawberry jam or conserves in taste (less sweet/concentrated flavor), but resembles fruit punch in looks and consistency. It is very easy to adjust this recipe and scale it up/down.
FYI, I suggest using organic strawberries for this (may be on the expensive side), it makes a world of difference in flavor.</description></item><item><title>Orange jam</title><link>/android_asset/html/posts/orange-jam/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/android_asset/html/posts/orange-jam/</guid><description>This jam is a traditional topping for the Polish mazurek, but can be used as a generic sweet spread.
