      <description>This is a recipe for a basic loaf of bread. The dough itself can be used however. I&amp;rsquo;ve made buns, rolls, and whole bread loafs using this same exact dough every time without a problem. Eat within 3 days as it will probably be going stale around then (as bread without preservatives and other junk should).
Ingredients  1 1/2 cups warm water 2 and 1/4 teaspoons Active Dry Yeast 1 Tsp sugar 2 Tbsp maple syrup, agave, or honey 1/2 Tbsp salt 3 3/4 cups Unbleached All-Purpose Flour (plus more for rolling / dusting)  Directions  Proof the yeast.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve never made your own sourdough bread, it can be intimidating! But I believe it is absolutely worth the time and effort. You can look up videos to explain some of the methods listed, such as the stretch and fold, or different ways to shape your loaf. Fermenting grains has been a tradition of home cooking for millennia, and an art only lost in recent years. Fermenting grains has numerous health benefits, is much easier to digest, and even contains natural preservatives.</description>
