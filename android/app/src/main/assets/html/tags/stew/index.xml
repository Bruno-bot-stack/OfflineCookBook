      <title>Traditional beef or lamb stew</title>

      <description>This is a recipe for a typical Irish stew. This is traditionally made with lamb since it&amp;rsquo;s cheaper however, beef tastes a lot better and is more readily available in North America I&amp;rsquo;ve been told. This is good if you want to feed a family or if you just want to be lazy and eat the same thing for 2 or 3 days. Besides browning the meat this is really just throwing stuff into a pot in a certain order.</description>
