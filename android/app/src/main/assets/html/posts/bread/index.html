      <p>This is a recipe for a basic loaf of bread. The dough itself can be used however. I&rsquo;ve made buns, rolls, and whole bread loafs using this same exact dough every time without a problem. Eat within 3 days as it will probably be going stale around then (as bread without preservatives and other junk should).</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
<li>2 and 1/4 teaspoons Active Dry Yeast</li>
<li>1 Tsp sugar</li>
<li>2 Tbsp  maple syrup, agave, or honey</li>
<li>1/2 Tbsp salt</li>
<li>3 3/4 cups Unbleached All-Purpose Flour (plus more for rolling / dusting)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Proof the yeast. To do this warm 1/4 cup water to about bath water heat (110 degrees F, 43 degrees C) add active dry yeast and 1 Tsp sugar. Let sit for about 10 minutes, mixture should at least be doubled in size after waiting.</li>
<li>Combine rest of water, yeast mixture, maple syrup (or other sweetener), salt, and flour in a large mixing bowl and stir. The result will be a sticky, rough dough. Use a spoon to stir until well combined and when it can no longer do the job, knead and turn it in the bowl with your hands.</li>
<li>Lift the dough out and lightly grease the bowl with nonstick spray or olive oil. Cover and let rise for 2 hours at room temperature.</li>
<li>Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until dough is elastic. Rule of thumb is 10 minutes of kneading.</li>
<li>Place seam-side down in a lightly greased loaf pan or baking sheet. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 45-60 minutes.</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C)* toward the end of the dough resting time and place a metal pan (NOT glass, Pyrex, or ceramic) on the lowest oven rack. Also have 1 cup of hot water ready.</li>
<li>When the oven is preheated, slash the bread 2 or 3 times with a knife, making a cut about Â½-inch deep.</li>
<li>Place in oven on middle rack. Then carefully pour hot water into the shallow pan on the rack beneath. Expect it to bubble and steam; then close oven door quickly.</li>
<li>Bake the bread for 26 to 35 minutes, or until deep golden brown and risen. Tapping the top of the loaf should produce a hollow sound.</li>
<li>Remove the bread from the oven and let rest in the pan for 5 minutes. Then carefully remove from pan and transfer to a cooling rack to cool. Let it cool completely before slicing for best results (otherwise it can be doughy in the middle).</li>
<li>Store leftovers in a plastic bag at room temperature for up to a few days. Transfer to freezer for longer term storage.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Instant yeast is not recommended as you can&rsquo;t easily tell if the bread will come to life.</li>
<li>For whole wheat version use 2 cups of whole wheat bread and 1 and 3/4 cup unbleached all purpose flour.</li>
<li>Add sunflower seeds and/or rolled oats for extra flavor/grains.</li>
<li>For buns or rolls divide dough into smaller pieces before second rest. Shape them and then let the dough rest. Recommended lowering oven temperature to 350 F and not using water as those will result in a hard crust and potentially dry interior.</li>
</ul>
