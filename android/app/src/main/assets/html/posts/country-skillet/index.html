<p>If you are feeling quite hungry after just waking up and want to have a
breakfast to fill your HP and stamina bars for the day, I&rsquo;ve got just the
perfect recipe for you.</p>
<p>To be honest, this is more of a build-your-own dish. What I am providing here, I
would say, is more of a starting point and you&rsquo;re more than welcome to add (or
remove) anything you&rsquo;d like. I also have to say that this is not exclusively a
breakfast dish, I&rsquo;ve had it for breakfast, for lunch, for supper, for dinner,
etc. Although, I guess when you&rsquo;re a student just any food at any time of the
day will do.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>Since I more often than not cook this only for myself, the ingredient list below
is calculated for one person. Once more, this is not a strict ingredient list,
so you can really add anything you want. I would say that the only ingredients
that are a most are the eggs and the potatoes. The rest of the ingredients I
will mark with * for the ones that I usually use, and ** for ingredients that I
have used, but seldom use.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>2 small/medium-sized potatoes</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Black pepper</li>
<li>4-6 bacon strips*</li>
<li>½ an onion*</li>
<li>Cheese (I usually use Gouda)*</li>
<li>Paprika*</li>
<li>A couple of Champignon &lsquo;shrooms**</li>
<li>Some slices of bell pepper**</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cut the bacon into pieces and fry it on a pan.</li>
<li>Cut the potatoes into small cubes.</li>
<li>After frying the bacon, set aside and use the bacon grease to fry the
potatoes over medium/medium-low heat for about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Add some salt and paprika to the potatoes, mix well and cook for another ten
minutes.</li>
<li>Cut the onions and add them to the frying pan. Cook for about five minutes.</li>
<li>If you decide to add some vegetables, like mushrooms or peppers, add them
now.</li>
<li>Now, there are two ways you can cook the eggs.*
<ul>
<li>Beat the eggs in a bowl and the pour them onto the pan.</li>
<li>Or just crack the eggs directly on the mix in the pan and mix everything
thoroughly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cut the cheese into small slices and add it.</li>
<li>Cook for a couple of minutes more, until eggs are cooked enough. Don&rsquo;t let
the eggs dry (unless that&rsquo;s the way you like your eggs ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).</li>
<li>For the final touch, chop the parsley (or whatever other spices/herbs you
decided to use) and add it on top.</li>
<li>Serve hot and add some freshly ground pepper.</li>
</ol>
<p>*Personally, I prefer to beat the eggs first in a bowl before adding them to the
frying pan.</p>
