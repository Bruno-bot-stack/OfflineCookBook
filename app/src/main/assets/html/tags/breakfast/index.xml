      <description>If you are feeling quite hungry after just waking up and want to have a breakfast to fill your HP and stamina bars for the day, I&amp;rsquo;ve got just the perfect recipe for you.
To be honest, this is more of a build-your-own dish. What I am providing here, I would say, is more of a starting point and you&amp;rsquo;re more than welcome to add (or remove) anything you&amp;rsquo;d like. I also have to say that this is not exclusively a breakfast dish, I&amp;rsquo;ve had it for breakfast, for lunch, for supper, for dinner, etc.</description>

We cover both rolled and steel cut oats. Instant need not apply.
