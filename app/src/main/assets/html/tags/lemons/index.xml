But if you don&amp;rsquo;t have that then you can use a large roasting tray with sides and cover it with foil, sealing it as best you can. It&amp;rsquo;s an excellent celebration or Sunday meal.
Ingredients Lamb shoulder, or something similar, like lamb shank, preferably on the bone. Get something that will fit in your pot, with room for vegetables around it.</description></item><item><title>Limoncello</title><link>/android_asset/html/posts/limoncello/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/android_asset/html/posts/limoncello/</guid><description> ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 10 min üç≥Wait time: 20 days üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 22 Ingredients 5-7 organic lemons (regular lemons are covered in wax) 300ml 95% ABV grain alcohol 700ml water 500ml sugar Directions Pour the alcohol into a 1 liter mason jar Peel the lemons avoiding the white pith (it will make your limoncello bitter) and submerse them in the alcohol Cover the jar and let the lemons infuse the alcohol for 20 days After the infusion is completed, create a simple syrup by boiling the water and dissolving the sugar in the water Allow the water to cool completely, then strain the alcohol into the sugar water and stir Bottle or put it back into the mason jar Feel free to scale the recipe up or down, and adjust the sugar to the sweetness you like, but the ABV should remain somewhere around 28-30%</description></item></channel></rss>
