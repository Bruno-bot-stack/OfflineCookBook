      <description>I first learned this recipe from a Bishop I had growing up. It produces quite a good steak despite the unconventional ingredients.
Ingredients  Steak Kosher Salt Mustard Powder Tabasco Sauce  Directions  Rub a generous amount of salt all over the steak Coat the entire steak with mustard powder Pour Tabasco Sauce onto both sides of the steak, don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to put more on than you think you might otherwise be comfortable with the salt will cancel out a lot of the spice while grilling.</description>

      <description>This is the most traditional dish that every household eats in Quebec. As a kid, you would eat P√¢t√© Chinois at least once a week, either at home or at the school&amp;rsquo;s cafeteria,. It is very similar to a Shepherd‚Äôs Pie, as it is divided in 3 layers of ingredients: meat, legumes and mashed potatoes. The literal translation of the name is something like chinese pie. You can search for the origin of the name on the internet, I&amp;rsquo;m not an history teacher.</description>
