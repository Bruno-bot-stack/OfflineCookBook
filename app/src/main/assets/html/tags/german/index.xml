      <description>A recipe for Gl√ºhwein/mulled wine a beverage you can find at almost every European christmas market. This recipe is my favorite one - optimized for flavor rather than alcohol content (it still kicks in).
 üçΩÔ∏è Servings:1-4  Ingredients for 1 liter of Gl√ºhwein
 300 ml Cassis-Juice (Johannesbeer), if you can&amp;rsquo;t find it you can replace it with another juice, I did it e.g. with cranberry pomegranate juice 1 bottle 700ml red wine (I prefer Primitivo/Zinfandel), don&amp;rsquo;t buy a cheap cooking wine, you want to drink it :) 50 g Sugar 25 g Raisins 1 orange 1 cinamon bark 1 spoon ginger powder (or a bit of fresh ginger) 1 spoon cloves 5 star anise if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the spices you can also just throw in sweet cinamon tea bags instead (or similar), they contain most spices - I took 6 teabags for 1 litre  Directions  cut the orange in nice looking pieces (since they are mainly decoration) throw everything in a pot warm up (don&amp;rsquo;t boil) enjoy  Contributors  Bernhard Egger &amp;ndash; website, twitter  </description>
