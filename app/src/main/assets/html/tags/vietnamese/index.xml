&lt;p>Vietnamese Pho Soup is a tea-like, beef based soup with a flavor profile that differentiates it from the traditional Western palette. This recipe is designed to be as easy to make as possible, while simultaneously being as based as possible.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Garlic (4-8 large cloves)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spring Onions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cardamom Seeds (10 or so)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Star Anise (4-5)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ginger&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cinnamon Sticks (3-5 sticks)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Diced Beef (300g)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Beef Bones with marrow (3x)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Beef bouillon cubes (1-3)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Coriander (to taste)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 Lime (to taste)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fish/Oyster Sauce&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Honey or Brown Sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rice noodles&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Heat your oven and place the spices (garlic, cardamom seeds, cinnamon sticks, star anise and ginger) on a tray and bake them until browned or decently toasted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Boil bones until you remove most of the scum, and transfer the spices from the oven into the pot. Life will be easier if you can place the spices in a tea strainer of sorts, otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s not the worst thing in the world fishing them out later on.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add beef bouillon cubes, diced beef, fish/oyster sauce, and honey/sugar, then simmer for a couple hours with the lid on.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cook the rice noodles (should only take a few minutes, just until the texture is al dente enough).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once the broth is done cooking, fish out the spices that you added at step 2. It&amp;rsquo;s worth doing this rather than accidentally chewing on a bit of star anise, trust me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cut up coriander and spring onions as garnish.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add rice noodles to bowl, followed by the broth and its contents, followed by the garnish. This can be made and eaten within 1 hour if you want it quickly, but typically with broths the longer you simmer the tastier it&amp;rsquo;ll be.&lt;/li>
