Anglerfish (I&amp;rsquo;m referring specifically to the &amp;lsquo;monfish/sea-devil&amp;rsquo; variant) meat is mild, absorbing the butter and subtle flavours of the herbs. Preparing the anglerfish is an involved process that I&amp;rsquo;ll try and explain to the best of my abilities but watching someone do it would be more then helpful.
Ingredients 1 Anglerfish Butter, enough to fry with Chives or green onions Marjoram, fresh herbs are preferable Directions Preparing the fish Turn the creature on its back.</description></item><item><title>Tuna Sub</title><link>/android_asset/html/posts/tuna-sub/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/android_asset/html/posts/tuna-sub/</guid><description>Use the best tuna you can find.
