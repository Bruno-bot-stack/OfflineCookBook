and can be made with either Lamb or Mutton. Best served with a sauce such as an &lt;a href="/android_asset/html/onion-raitha">onion raitha&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A plated rendering of the dish, made with Mutton. Makes a really hearty ,meaty and delicious dish. The dishes uses a rice to meat ratio of 2:3.
PS: the biriyani tastes better the longer it&amp;rsquo;s allowed to soak in it&amp;rsquo;s flavour after cooking.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
