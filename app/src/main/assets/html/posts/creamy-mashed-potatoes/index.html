<p>Mashed potatoes is a really great recipe that is often relegated to the position
of side dish. This recipe is a spin of the classical mashed potatoes recipe
that&rsquo;s got itself more going on. You can serve this dish for a relatively light
meal, or you can also serve it as a side dish if you want to have a really
hearty meal.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>The quantities here are for about four adult portions. If you are planning on
eating this as a side dish, it might be more like 6-8 portions.</p>
<ul>
<li>1kg potatoes</li>
<li>200ml milk*</li>
<li>200ml mayonnaise*</li>
<li>~100g cheese</li>
<li>Garlic powder</li>
<li>12-16 strips of bacon</li>
<li>Butter</li>
<li>3-4 green onions</li>
<li>Black pepper</li>
<li>Salt</li>
</ul>
<p>*You can play with the proportions depending on how creamy or dry you want the
mashed potatoes to be.</p>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Peel and cut the potatoes into medium sized pieces.</li>
<li>Put the potatoes in a pot with some water so that it covers the potatoes and
boil them for about 20-30 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft.</li>
<li>About ten minutes before removing the potatoes from the boiling water, cut
the bacon into little pieces and fry it.</li>
<li>Warm up the milk and mayonnaise.</li>
<li>Shred the cheese.</li>
<li>When the potatoes are done, remove all water from the pot, add the warm milk
and mayonnaise mix, add some butter, and mash with a potato masher or a
blender.</li>
<li>Add some salt, black pepper and garlic powder to taste and continue mashing
the mix.</li>
<li>Once the mix is somewhat homogeneous and the potatoes are properly mashed,
add the shredded cheese and fried bacon and mix a little.</li>
<li>Serve and top with chopped green onions.</li>
</ol>
